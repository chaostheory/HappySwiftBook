## Numbers

### Integers

Since we've already started using numbers in Swift, let's continue exploring them.

To increment an Int variable:

```javascript
var numberOfEggs = 1
numberOfEggs += 3
print(numberOfEggs)
```

Result:

```javascript
4
```

Decrementing an Int variable is similar:

```javascript
var numberOfEggs = 5
numberOfEggs -= 3
print(numberOfEggs)
```

Result:

```javascript
2
```

### Doubles (Floats)

Most operations that apply to Ints are the same for Doubles.

```javascript
var yolkPercentage = 49.46
yolkPercentage += 34.2
yolkPercentage -= 53.752
print(yolkPercentage)
```
