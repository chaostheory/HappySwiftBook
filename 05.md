## Sets

Sets are similar to arrays. The main difference is that a set must contain unique elements of the same type.

### Setting Up

Another difference is unlike arrays, sets need explicit initialization (but Swift can figure out the data type).

```javascript
var swiftDiet: Set = ["lady bug", "moth", "beetle"]
```

You can be more explicit in setting up a set.

```javascript
var swiftDiet: Set<String> = ["lady bug", "moth", "beetle"]
var emptySet = Set<String>()
```

### Accessing

Checking if a set is empty is similar to checking if an array is empty.

```javascript
var swiftDiet: Set = ["lady bug", "moth", "beetle"]
print(swiftDiet.isEmpty)
print(swiftDiet.count)
```
The end result would be

```javascript
false
3
```

You can sort all the elements.

```javascript
var swiftDiet: Set = ["lady bug", "moth", "beetle"]
print(swiftDiet.sort())
```

The end result would be

```javascript
["beetle", "lady bug", "moth"]
```

As for iteration, to visit each of the set's elements one by one, we will cover that in the next chapter.

### Comparison

Swift includes set methods to help you compare two different sets.

To find elements common to both sets:

```javascript
var crowDiet: Set = ["lady bug", "moth", "beetle", "apple", "bread", "mouse", "frog"]
var owlDiet: Set = ["rabbit", "mouse", "frog"]
print(crowDiet.intersect(owlDiet))
```
The end result would be

```javascript
["frog", "mouse"]
```

To find elements that both sets do NOT share in common:

```javascript
var crowDiet: Set = ["lady bug", "moth", "beetle", "apple", "bread", "mouse", "frog"]
var owlDiet: Set = ["rabbit", "mouse", "frog"]
print(crowDiet.exclusiveOr(owlDiet))
```
The end result would be

```javascript
["moth", "rabbit", "beetle", "lady bug", "apple", "bread"]
```

To create a new set with all the values from both sets:



To create a new set without values from the two sets in question:




### Modifying

To insert a new element into a set:

```javascript
var emptySet = Set<String>()
emptySet.insert("cherry")
```

To remove an element, simply call the remove method with the element to remove.

```javascript
var swiftDiet: Set = ["lady bug", "moth", "beetle"]
var removedBirdFood = swiftDiet.remove("moth")
print(swiftDiet)
print(removedBirdFood)
```

The end result would be

```javascript
["lady bug", "beetle"]
"moth"
```
