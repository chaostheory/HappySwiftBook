## While Loops

Like for loops, while loops are used for repeating logic. The main difference between the two is that for loops work on a counter and range, but while loops keep running as long as its condition is true.

```javascript
var index = 1
let endOfTheLine = 4
while(index <= endOfTheLine) {
    index += 1
}
print("All done! Index is \(index)")
//All done! Index is 5
```

The condition in the above example is index <= endOfTheLine. The work being repeated by the while loop is incrementing the variable called index.


## Repeat While Loops

```javascript
var index = 1
let endOfTheLine = 4
repeat {
    index += 1
}while(index <= endOfTheLine)
print("All done! Index is \(index)")
//All done! Index is 5
```
