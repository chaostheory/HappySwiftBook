## Booleans

A boolean is a type of value that can only have two possible values: true and false. Typically booleans are in places that utilize conditions.

```javascript
var booleanOpt: Bool
var birdsLoveWorms = true
var wormsLoveWorms = false
```

As with other variables of a different type, you can declare booleans as an optional or explicitly.

## Conditions

Conditions are that will result in a boolean value.

```javascript
let a = 1
let b = 2

// is a greater than b?
print(a > b)
// is a less than b?
print(a < b)
// is a greater than or equal to b?
print(a >= b)
// is a less than or equal to b?
print(a <= b)
// is a equal to b?
print(a == b)
//false
//true
//false
//true
//false
```
