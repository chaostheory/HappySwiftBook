## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are collections of key value pairs. What are keys and values?
This is a really simple example of a key value pair.

```javascript
"firstName": "Brian"
```

firstName is the key and Brian is the value.

### Setting Up

You can create an empty dictionary.

```javascript
var emptyDictionary =  [String: Int]()

```

What you need to declare (ie tell Swift) is the type of data of both keys and values. In the example above, keys will be Strings and values will be Ints.

Like other collections, you can also create an already initialized dictionary.

```javascript
var birdFood: [String: Int] = ["olives": 50, "worms": 80, "walnuts": 90]
```


### Accessing

To access the value of a key, do this:

```javascript
print(birdFood["worms"])
```

The result is:

```javascript
80
```

To determine the number of key value pairs inside a dictionary, use the count method.

```javascript
print(birdFood.count)
```

The result is:

```javascript
3
```

Like other collections, you can use the isEmpty method to determine whether or not the dictionary has key value pairs.

```javascript
print(birdFood.isEmpty)
```

The result is:

```javascript
false
```

If you need to access of of a dictionary's keys as an array, do the following:

let birdFoodNames = [String](birdFood.keys)

As for iteration, to visit each of the dictionary's elements one by one, we will cover that in the next chapter.

let birdFoodValues = [String](birdFood.values)

### Modifying

To set a name value pair, reference the key that you want to assign a value.

```javascript
birdFood["moths"] = 23
```

If a key like "moths" doesn't already exist in the dictionary, you will create a new key value pair; resulting in:

```javascript
["olives": 50, "worms": 80, "walnuts": 90, "moths": 23]
```

If it already exists, you will overwrite the existing value with the new one.

```javascript
birdFood["moths"] = 13
```

This results in:

```javascript
["olives": 50, "worms": 80, "walnuts": 90, "moths": 13]
```

An alternative method for updating a key is using the updateValue method.

```javascript
var oldMothNumber = birdFood.updateValue(14, forKey: "moths")
```

Why use it? The updateValue method will return the original value, helping you figure out whether or not you changed the key's value. If the key value pair is new, then the result would be nil.

If you want to clear out a dictionary, making it empty; do this:

```javascript
var birdFood = [:]
```

If the goal is just to remove a key, set the key to nil.

```javascript
birdFood["moths"] = nil
```
