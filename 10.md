## Functions

Imagine that you can record yourself cleaning the bathroom. Now imagine that once you're done recording your work, you can 'play it back' on a robot and the same exact work will be done. This is the best way to explain a function. Functions are a way to organize logic that's repeatedly used.

```javascript
func nameOfFunction() {
  //logic goes here
}
```

Looking at the above example, functions are declared with 'func' followed by the function's name. To execute a function, you need to call it (aka invoke it).

```javascript
nameOfFunction()
```

Sometimes a function will need input known as either a parameter or argument. We'll just call them parameters.

```javascript
func greet(hello: String) {
  print(hello)
}
greet("Salut")
//"Salut\n"
```

Functions can have one or more parameters. These parameters can be any Swift type.

```javascript
func greet(hello: String, goodbye: String) {
  print(hello)
  print(goodbye)
}
greet("Salut", goodbye: "Au revoir")
//"Salut\n"
//"Au revoir\n"
```



Eventually you'll want to your function to return a result. To do this, you need to declare the function's result type (in this case it's a String) and you need to explicitly return the result inside the function as shown below.

```javascript
func singBirdSong(songType: String, territoryType: String) -> String {
    var greeting: String?
    if songType == "Warning"
      greeting = "Stay away from my "
    else if songType == "Threat"
      greeting = "I will attack if you don't leave my "
    end
    //you need to return a String
    return "\(greeting) \(territoryType)."
}
singBirdSong("Warning", territoryType: "Nest")
//"Stay away from my Nest\n"
```

Remember when I said that parameters can be any Swift type? Well functions are also a Swift type that you can pass as a parameter.

Swift functions can also be returned as a result.
