## Strings

![dissection](images/worm_stuck.jpg)

How do you mix variable values into a String? You can add

```javascript
var firstPart = "The quick brown fox"
var secondPart = " jumped over the fence"
var foxySentence = firstPart + secondPart
```

foxySentence would equal:

```javascript
"The quick brown fox jumped over the fence"
```

You can also add non-String variables to a String if you convert them as seen
below.

```javascript
var balloonSentence = " loft balloons"
var numberOfBalloons = 99
var nenaRefrain = String(numberOfBalloons) + balloonSentence
```

nenaRefrain would equal:

```javascript
"99 loft balloons"
```

```javascript
var wings = 2
var claws = 2
var appleSummary = "I have \(wings) wings."
var fruitSummary = "I have \(wings + claws) appendages."
```
