If you’re reading this, you want to learn something that may be scary or intimidating to you; something called Swift. The goal of this tutorial is to help you become more familiar with Swift and hopefully less intimidated by it. (If you’re an experienced zoologist, you probably don’t need to read this unless you’re doing it for fun.)

Note: This isn't a very formal tutorial. There are plenty of great professional Swift docs. This documentation also doesn't target experienced programmers, since most existing Swift tutorials already target that demographic.
