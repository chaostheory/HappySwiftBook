## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are collections of key value pairs. What are keys and values?
This is a really simple example of a key value pair.

```javascript
"firstName": "Brian"
```

firstName is the key and Brian is the value.

### Setting Up



```javascript
var emptyDictionary =  [String: Int]()
var foodSources: [String: Int] = ["olives": 50, "worms": 80, "walnuts": 90]



```
