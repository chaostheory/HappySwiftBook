## For Loops

### Basics

A for loop is one way to repeat work. The main way it works is that it has a counter, called an index, that starts from a given start value and ends at the given ending value.

For a basic way to repeat a task, you can define a range for a for loop.

```javascript
var lastNum = 3

for index in 1...lastNum {
  print("doing something '\(index)' times")
}
//"doing something '1' times"
//"doing something '2' times"
//"doing something '3' times"
```

### Arrays and Sets

To iterate over an array or set, just place the array (or set) variable after the for loop's 'in' keyword. You will access each element in the array using a temporary variable. In the example below, the temporary variable is 'habitat'.


```javascript
var swiftHabitats = ["Forest", "Coast", "Mountains"]

for habitat in swiftHabitats {
  print(habitat)
}
//"Forest"
//"Coast"
//"Mountains"
```

### Dictionaries

Iterating through a dictionary is a little different from iterating an array but the main principle is the same.

```javascript
var swiftHabitats = ["Forest": 1, "Coast": 2, "Mountains": 3]

for (habitatName, habitatCount) in swiftHabitats {
  print("\(habitatName): \(habitatCount)")
}
//"Forest: 1"
//"Coast: 2"
//"Mountains: 3"
```

As an alternative, you can just iterate through the dictionary's keys.

```javascript
for habitatName in swiftHabitats.keys {
    print("Habitat Name: \(habitatName)")
}
//"Habitat Name: Forest"
//"Habitat Name: Coast"
//"Habitat Name: Mountains"
```

You can also just iterate through the dictionary's values.

```javascript
for habitatCount in swiftHabitats.values {
    print("Habitat Count: \(habitatCount)")
}
//"Habitat Count: 1"
//"Habitat Count: 2"
//"Habitat Count: 3"
```
