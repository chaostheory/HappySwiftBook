## Basic Anatomy

The first step in being less intimidated of something, like Swift, is to start trying to understand it.

### Variables

What’s a variable? It’s a placeholder for a value. Something for Swift to remember.

```javascript
var numberOfFeathers = 1000
```

Looking above, numberOfFeathers is a variable that holds the integer value of 1000.

There are several types of data: String, Int, Double, and so on. Once you assign one type of value to a variable, from then on you can only assign the same type of data e.g. once you assign a String type value to a variable like “Hello”,  then you’ll only be able to assign String type values to that variable like “Goodbye”.

What if you don't have a value for the variable yet?

```javascript
var numberOfFeathers: Int
```
You still need to make it clear what type of data the variable can hold. You can assign data later.

```javascript
var numberOfFeathers: Int
numberOfFeathers = 100
```


What if you want a variable never to change values?

```javascript
let veryImportantNumber = 43
```

veryImportantNumber is a constant. Constants are variables with one big difference. Once you assign a value, you can’t change it.
